# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.13.2] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- **Auto-register no longer dead-locks after a transient failure.** The
  `registerPromise` lock was set once and never cleared — a network blip
  on the first trigger left it pointing at a settled promise forever, so
  every subsequent trigger awaited it and proceeded token-less. One
  failed registration meant silent local-only mode for the whole process
  lifetime. The lock now clears on failure and retries are rate-limited
  to once per 60s.

### Changed
- **Internal: deduplicated `classifySeverity` and host-config paths.**
  `classifySeverity` lived in both `server/shared.mjs` and
  `server/server.mjs`; the latter now imports the shared one. MCP
  host-config paths were duplicated between `server/server.mjs` and
  `bin/cli.mjs` — extracted to a canonical `server/hosts.mjs` consumed
  by both. No behavior change; eliminates two drift points.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **v2 telemetry envelope** for anonymous decision events. Same shape
  as decoy-scan 0.7.0 / decoy-redteam 0.3.0 — schema_version, event_id,
  run_id, env block (node/platform/arch/ci/host/locale).
- **Batched decisions.** Proxy + server now buffer decision events in
  memory (10 events or 5 seconds) and flush as a single batched POST.
  Reduces network chatter on busy MCP sessions.
- **Persistent queue on failure.** Events that fail to ship fall
  through to `~/.decoy/telemetry-queue.jsonl`; the next proxy/server
  start drains them.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- `reportTrigger` now runs entirely on a `setImmediate` tick so its
  synchronous portion (including the visible `[decoy] TRIGGER` stderr
  log) can never block the honey-tool response. The 0.12.0 redaction
  added enough sync work to push response timing past 5s on
  back-pressured pipes (saw failures on macOS-latest CI runners).
  Honey-tool MCP responses now go out before any telemetry work runs.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- **Anonymous default-on telemetry.** Decision events are now sent to
  `/api/telemetry` (anonymous, identified by `~/.decoy/install_id`) when no
  `DECOY_TOKEN` is set. Authenticated installs still post to
  `/mcp/{token}` as before. Previously, unauthenticated installs sent
  nothing at all — the highest-volume telemetry source was dark.
- **Argument redaction.** All tool arguments are reduced to type/length
  shape before transmission (e.g. `{path: "<string:42>"}`). The redactor
  applies on both authed and anonymous paths, so raw tool arguments never
  leave the client. For block decisions on critical/high severity, an
  `argsFingerprint` (sha256 prefix) is attached so we can correlate the
  same payload across installs without storing the payload itself.
  `server/redact.mjs` is the privacy boundary; `test/redact.test.mjs`
  enforces that no raw values can leak.

### Changed
- `emitDecoyEvent` and `server.mjs`'s reportTrigger both route through the
  redactor. `DECOY_TELEMETRY=0` now disables both authed and anonymous
  paths; previously there was no opt-out for the authenticated path.

## [0.11.6] - 2026-05-06

### Added
- `init` now prints a one-line GitHub star ask after the post-install summary.
  Mirrors the same line in `decoy-scan` and `decoy-redteam`, so users running
  multiple Decoy CLIs see consistent post-run output.

## [0.11.5] - 2026-04-28

### Changed
- **`init` now uses a browser + paste flow by default**, matching
  `decoy-scan`'s `loginInteractive` UX. The CLI opens
  `https://app.decoy.run/dashboard?tab=settings#s-setup` and prompts the user
  to paste their token. Works for both new and existing accounts —
  `/api/signup` is anti-enumeration-locked for known emails, so the previous
  `--email`-first flow silently failed for any returning user.
  - `init --token=XXX` still works for CI / scripted installs.
  - `init --email=foo@bar.com` still works for fresh emails as a fast path,
    and falls back to the browser flow if `/api/signup` doesn't return a
    token (anti-enumeration response or rate limit).
- The pasted/passed token is now verified against `/api/triggers` before
  any host config is touched, so an invalid token never leaves you with a
  broken install.

### Fixed
- **`init` no longer silently writes broken configs when `/api/signup` returns
  no token.** Previously the CLI plowed past this with `data.token === undefined`,
  rewrote every host config with `env: {}` (since `JSON.stringify` drops
  undefined values), printed `Token: undefined`, and left tripwires unable
  to authenticate. The CLI now detects the missing token and falls back to
  the browser flow (or aborts cleanly in non-TTY environments).

## [0.11.4] - 2026-04-28

### Fixed
- `decoy-tripwire upgrade` now opens
  `https://app.decoy.run/dashboard?tab=settings#s-plan` (the Plan section)
  instead of the dashboard overview, so users land directly on the upgrade
  picker. Matches the dashboard's own internal Upgrade CTAs.

### Changed
- `upgrade` copy now says "Upgrade to Team" and lists current Team-tier
  features (Slack/webhook alerts, threat intel, continuous scanning) instead
  of the legacy "Upgrade to Pro / exposure analysis" wording.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- **Auto-block on tripwire hit.** When a tripwire fires, the tripped agent is paused for 10 minutes (configurable). Subsequent tool calls in any wrapped upstream are denied sub-millisecond via a shared pause registry at `~/.decoy/pause.json`.
- **Desktop notifications** on tripwire hit — native macOS/Linux/Windows alerts surface the tool name, the paused agent, and the TTL.
- **`init` now wraps existing upstream MCP servers** through the local proxy by default, so auto-block covers your whole setup. Pass `--no-wrap` to keep upstreams un-proxied.
- **New CLI commands**:
  - `resume <agent-id>` / `resume --all` — clear an auto-pause immediately.
  - `lock <agent-id>` / `lock --all` — convert an auto-pause into a permanent block.
  - `lockdown on|off|status` — when on, one tripwire pauses every agent, not just the tripped one.
- **Local `status` section** — `decoy-tripwire status` now shows active local pauses above the hosted trigger list.
- New local config at `~/.decoy/config.json` (`lockdownMode`, `pauseTtlMs`, `desktopNotifications`) with read-time migration for the legacy `paranoidMode` key.
- `DECOY_HOME` env var to override the registry/config location, used for test isolation.

### Changed
- Help text reorganized so `resume`/`lock`/`lockdown` sit under a new "When a tripwire fires:" section; `proxy` moved to its own "Proxy (advanced):" section.
- Post-install "Next:" message clarified — tripwires activate on MCP host reconnect; `test` is now an optional verify step, not a required one.

### Fixed
- Test isolation — proxy tests now use `DECOY_HOME` so spawned CLI subprocesses don't write to the real `~/.decoy/pause.json`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-21

### Changed
